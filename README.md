# Discription on Project
  This project is intended to develop a robot than can detect and put off the fire. The driver module used in this project is capable of controlling two motors of chassis, and IR   sensors can detect flame upto a distance around 80 cm along with detection angle around 60 degrees. The pump motor is mounted on servo motor such that it can be rotated in         desired direction for watering action. As we are using three sensors our robot is capable of sensing in a semicircular area of radius around 80 cm.<br/>
